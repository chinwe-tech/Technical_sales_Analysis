# 📊 Device Usage vs Purchases Analysis

This project analyzes how customer activity differs across **Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet** devices.  
The visualization compares the number of **pages viewed** against the **total purchases**, highlighting differences in browsing and buying behavior.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Identify which device type drives the **most browsing activity**.  
- Compare browsing (page views) vs. actual **purchase conversions**.  
- Reveal gaps between customer interest and buying behavior.

- **Blue Bars:** Total pages viewed per device type  
- **Orange Line:** Total purchases per device type  
- **X-Axis:** Device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)  
- **Y-Axis Left:** Number of pages viewed  
- **Y-Axis Right:** Number of purchases  

---

## 🔎 Insights
- **Mobile** users viewed the highest number of pages (~5,000) and also made the most purchases (~450).  
- **Desktop** users viewed fewer pages (~4,200) but purchases were much lower (~400), suggesting less engagement-to-purchase conversion.  
- **Tablet** users viewed fewer pages than mobile but slightly more than desktop; purchases were lower than mobile but close to desktop.  

📌 Key Takeaway:  
- Mobile is the **strongest channel** for both browsing and purchases.  
- Desktop and Tablet users browse less and convert less, but the **gap between views and purchases** is narrower compared to Mobile.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Pivot Tables for aggregation  
  - Combo Chart (Bar + Line) for comparing two metrics  
- **Metrics Analyzed**  
  - `Total_Pages_Viewed`  
  - `Total_Purchases`  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Calculate **conversion rate** = Purchases ÷ Pages Viewed per device.  
- Drill down by **customer demographics** to see if device preference varies.  
- Test targeted strategies to improve **desktop/tablet conversions**.
